# FingerprintJS Integration - Testing Guide

## Overview
This project now includes FingerprintJS for user fingerprinting and enhanced security. The integration provides:

1. **Device Fingerprinting**: Unique visitor identification across sessions
2. **Security Logging**: All authentication events are logged with fingerprint data
3. **Risk Analysis**: Behavioral analysis for detecting suspicious activity
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Visual fingerprint information in the dashboard

## Key Features

### 1. Fingerprint Hook (`useFingerprint`)
Located in `/src/hooks/useFingerprint.tsx`, this custom hook provides:
- `fingerprintData`: Complete fingerprint information
- `isLoading`: Loading state
- `refreshFingerprint()`: Manually refresh fingerprint
- `logFingerprintForSecurity()`: Log security events

### 2. Components
- **FingerprintDisplay**: Shows fingerprint data in a card format
- **SecurityLogs**: Admin page to view all fingerprint security logs

### 3. Backend Endpoints
- `POST /security/log-fingerprint`: Log security events with fingerprint data
- `GET /security/fingerprint-logs`: Retrieve security logs (with filtering)

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
source myenv/bin/activate  # or activate your Python environment
python app.py
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
# From the project root
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```

### 3. Test Scenarios

#### A. Account Creation
1. Navigate to the login page
2. Click "Create an account"
3. Fill in the form with valid details
4. Proceed through the biometric enrollment (type email 3 times)
5. Check the fingerprint logs at `/app/security-logs`

#### B. Login with Fingerprint Match
1. Use an existing account
2. Type the email exactly as trained during enrollment
3. The system should recognize the typing pattern and ask for password only
4. Check security logs for "biometric_verification_success"

#### C. Login with Fingerprint Mismatch
1. Use an existing account
2. Deliberately type the email differently (different rhythm/speed)
3. The system should detect a mismatch and require both password and OTP
4. Check security logs for "biometric_verification_failed"

#### D. Dashboard Fingerprint Display
1. After successful login, go to the dashboard
2. Scroll down to see the "Security & Device Information" section
3. View your device's fingerprint data
4. Click "Refresh Fingerprint" to get new data

### 4. Security Log Analysis

Navigate to `/app/security-logs` to view:
- All authentication events
- Fingerprint data for each event
- Device information (browser, OS)
- Confidence scores
- Filtering by email or action type

## Available Actions in Logs

- `email_verification_attempt`: User started login process
- `biometric_verification_success`: Typing pattern matched
- `biometric_verification_failed`: Typing pattern didn't match
- `login_success`: Successful login with password
- `login_success_via_otp`: Successful login with OTP
- `login_failed_wrong_password`: Wrong password entered
- `login_attempt_failed_email_not_found`: Email not registered
- `account_creation_attempt`: User tried to create account

## Configuration

The FingerprintJS configuration is in `App.tsx`:
```tsx
<FpjsProvider
  loadOptions={{
    apiKey: "a8wE09Hz9apq7oAHkM1B", // Your API key
    region: "ap" // Asia-Pacific region
  }}
>
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Device Tracking**: Track login attempts across different devices
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Detect when users' typing patterns change
3. **Fraud Detection**: Combine fingerprinting with other security measures
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete log of all authentication events
5. **Risk Scoring**: Foundation for advanced risk assessment

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Risk Scoring**: Use fingerprint data in the existing risk sidebar
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Flag unusual fingerprint patterns
3. **Geographic Analysis**: Combine with location data
4. **ML Integration**: Train models on fingerprint + behavioral data
5. **Real-time Alerts**: Notify admins of suspicious patterns

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `/src/hooks/useFingerprint.tsx`
- `/src/components/FingerprintDisplay.tsx`
- `/src/pages/SecurityLogs.tsx`

### Modified Files:
- `/src/App.tsx` - Added FpjsProvider wrapper
- `/src/pages/Login.tsx` - Integrated fingerprint logging
- `/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Added fingerprint display
- `/src/components/TopBar.tsx` - Added security logs navigation
- `/backend/app.py` - Added fingerprint logging endpoints
- `/src/pages/Index.tsx` - Removed duplicate FpjsProvider

The integration is complete and ready for testing! The system now captures and logs device fingerprints for all authentication events, providing a foundation for advanced security monitoring and fraud detection.
